  - Count the number of customers by cities and states who placed orders during the analysis period.

- **Analyze Trends Over Time:**
  - Investigate if the number of orders placed has been growing over the past years.
  - Examine if there are seasonal trends, such as monthly peaks in order volume.
  - Analyze Brazilian customers' order times to determine if they tend to place orders more during specific times of the day (e.g., morning, afternoon, or night).

- **Explore State-wise Order Trends:**
  - Track month-on-month order counts for each state, to see how order behavior varies across regions.
  - Investigate how customers are distributed across different states, identifying areas with higher or lower order volumes.

- **Examine Financial Impact:**
